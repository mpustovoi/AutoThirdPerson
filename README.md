# Auto Third Person but it's for ~~fabric~~ fabric and forge ~~1.16~~ ~~1.17~~ 1.18

Puts you in third person when you do certain things.

LGPL 3.0 or later.

## A note on config

The mod can be configured through its config file. Reload resources (F3+T), or use the client-command `/auto_third_person reload` to re-read the file. It doesn't use the standard Forge config system.
